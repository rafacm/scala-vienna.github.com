    <h1>Coding Dojo Takeaways</h1>

    <p>This is a (non-exhaustive) list of takeaways after one of our dojos:
    <ol>
        <li>There has to be <strong>one product manager</strong> that makes decisions about the ambiguities of the Kata requirements.</li>
        <li>We need to be more <strong>disciplined</strong>. We need to have more structure for the Dojo and make sure that the structure (parts, participant roles, breaks, ...) is communicated at the beginning. </li>
        <li>We follow a BYODoSC policy: Bring Your Own Device or Stop Complaining about IDE, operating system and/or keyboard settings.</li>
        <li>Focus on <strong>baby steps</strong> all the time. If you take a baby step and it works before your time is over then you pass control to the next one.</li>
        <li>10 participants seems to be the maximum for group dynamics.</li>
        <li><strong>We did not listen enough</strong> to what others have to say.</li>
        <li>Everyone needs to be able to understand the direction we are going during the whole dojo.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not start coding if the idea is not clear</strong>.</li>
        <li>Take a break in the middle of the dojo to revisit the design.</li>
    </ol>
