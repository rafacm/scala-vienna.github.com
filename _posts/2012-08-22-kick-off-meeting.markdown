We talked about future interests of group members.

 * Most of us are interested in functional programming possible in Scala, more particularly about Monads, Streams etc.
 * Usage of collection library is another interesting thing, especially converting between collection representations, e.g. immutable to mutable, serial to parallel, lazy to direct.
 * [Martin][martin] presented [Lambdaheads][lambdaheads] group and requested [Alex][alex] for presentation of Scala in next meeting of group.
 * New features from version 2.10, especially: reflection, macros are another point of interest.
 * Real-world examples and usage of frameworks built in Scala, will be presented during next meetings.
 * This also applies to tools, like SBT, JRebel and IDEs.
